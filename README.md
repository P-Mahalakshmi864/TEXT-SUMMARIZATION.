This Java-based text summarization program demonstrates how to extract key sentences from a larger body of text to create a concise summary. It uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to calculate the significance of each word, allowing the program to rank and select the most important sentences. The code handles basic preprocessing, such as removing stop words and calculating word frequencies, and generates a summary of a specified length. This approach is useful for quickly understanding the main points of a text, saving time in content review, and aiding in tasks such as document indexing or search engine optimization. The program provides a simple yet effective way to implement text summarization using Java's built-in libraries and data structures.
